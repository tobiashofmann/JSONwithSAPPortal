Source code for the blog: 

SAP Portal application example showing how to make use of REST and JSON. Example works with NetWeaver 7.3 as it uses enum. Only the source code is included. This code needs to be imported into NWDS 7.3 and can be deployed from there.

Note: The example is not compilable as the json libraries are not included. They need to be downloaded from json.org and added to the src folder.
